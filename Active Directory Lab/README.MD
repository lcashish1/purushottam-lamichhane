## 🧭 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-on **Active Directory (AD)** environment setup for practical learning.  
It simulates a small business IT network using **Windows Server 2022** as the Domain Controller and a **Windows 11 client** joined to the domain.

The lab includes:
- Domain and DNS configuration  
- Organizational Unit (OU) structure  
- User and group management  
- Group Policy (GPO) deployment  
- File sharing with permissions  
- Backup and verification

## 🧩 Lab Environment

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Server OS** | Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller) |
| **Client OS** | Windows 11 Pro |
| **Domain Name** | lcashish1.local |
| **Network Type** | Internal / NAT (VirtualBox) |
| **Tools Used** | Server Manager, AD DS, DNS, Group Policy, PowerShell |

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Server Configuration
1. Installed Windows Server 2022 and renamed the host to `LCASHISH1`.  
2. Assigned static IP `192.168.1.116` with subnet `255.255.255.0`.  
3. Configured DNS to point to its own IP.  
4. Verified connectivity with client machines.

## 🧱 Step 2: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
1. Installed AD DS role using **Server Manager → Add Roles and Features**.  
2. Promoted the server to a Domain Controller and created a new forest: `lcashish1.local`.  
3. Restarted the server after configuration.

## 🧑‍💻 Step 3: Create Organizational Units (OUs)
Created OUs to logically organize users and computers for better management.

| OU Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Staff** | Regular employees |
| **IT** | Lab or training accounts |
| **Admin** | System administrators |

## 👥 Step 4: Create Users and Groups
- Created users in their respective OUs using **Active Directory Users and Computers**.  
- Assigned users to groups such as `Staff_Group`, `IT_Group`, and `Admin_group`.

## 🖥️ Step 5: Join Client Computer to Domain
1. On Windows 11 client, changed computer name and joined `lcashish1.local`.  
2. Entered domain admin credentials and restarted the system.  

**DNS Verification:**
```bash
nslookup lcashish1.local
```
✅ Output confirmed successful DNS resolution.

## ⚙️ Step 6: Group Policy Configuration
Applied several GPOs to control user environments and enhance security.

| GPO Name | Target OU | Policy Path | Setting | Test Result |
|-----------|------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| Set Desktop Wallpaper | Admin_group | User → Admin Templates → Desktop | Enabled (custom wallpaper) | Wallpaper applied successfully |
| Disable Control Panel | Staff_group | User → Admin Templates → Control Panel | Enabled | Control Panel blocked |
| Map Network Drive | LCASHISH1.local | User → Preferences → Drive Maps | \\LCASHISH1\SharedData | Drive Z: mapped successfully |

## 🗂️ Step 7: File Sharing & Permissions
1. Created shared folder `\\LCASHISH1\SharedData`.  
2. Set NTFS and sharing permissions:  
   - **Staff → Read/Write**  
   - **Students → Read Only**  
3. Automatically mapped drives using Group Policy.

## 🧰 Step 8: Backup & Maintenance
Used **Windows Server Backup** to perform regular system state and AD backups.  
Verified backups through event logs and recovery console.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Active Directory structure and domain setup  
- DNS configuration and troubleshooting  
- GPO creation, testing, and application  
- File sharing and access control  
- Windows Server management and backup  

---

## 💡 Next Steps
- Add DHCP role for automated IP address management  
- Connect a second client PC to test multi-user environments  
- Use PowerShell scripting to automate AD user creation
